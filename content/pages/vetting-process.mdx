      #### Every direct service provider listed on InReach is independently
      vetted by our trained volunteers to be a welcoming space for LGBTQ+ people
      facing persecution or discrimination.

      InReach is built for the diverse and intersectional LGBTQ+ community –
      InReach’s free platform lists verified services for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers,
      refugees and other immigrants, BIPOC communities, the transgender and
      gender nonconforming (TGNC) community, youth and caregivers, and more
      LGBTQ+ communities in need of safe resources.


      At InReach, we are dedicated to ensuring our [free resource
      platform](https://app.inreach.org/) is filled with high-quality,
      accessible, and welcoming direct service providers for LGBTQ+ people
      facing persecution or discrimination. Our trained volunteers conduct a
      rigorous, tailored vetting process for every provider listed on InReach.
      Our core vetting criteria include:


      1. Is the direct service provider active and legitimate? (required to be
      listed on InReach)

      2. Is the direct service provider LGBTQ+ affirming? (required to be listed
      on InReach)

      3. Does the direct service provider meet any of InReach’s
      intersectionality definitions? (preferred but not required to be listed on
      InReach)


      * At InReach, we understand that achieving LGBTQ+ equality requires trans
      justice, racial justice, refugee justice, reproductive justice, language
      justice, and more. Therefore, in addition to ensuring that each provider
      listed on InReach is generally LGBTQ+ affirming, our trained volunteers
      also verify whether providers are led by and/or have expertise in serving
      specific historically marginalized LGBTQ+ communities.

      * See our intersectionality definitions below for more information.


      Our team ensures these criteria are met by thoroughly researching and
      often directly communicating with each provider. Every provider listed on
      InReach has regularly updated documentation on these core criteria. We
      also evaluate additional features we value in the providers we publish,
      such as whether they offer translation services for non-English speaking
      clients and whether they have a confidentiality policy for their services.
      At the end of our vetting process, providers are classified as either
      “verified” or “unverified.” Unverified providers are deemed ineligible for
      inclusion on InReach, at least for the time being.


      **Examples of things we look for during our vetting process include:**
    _template: richText
  - content:
      - accordionTitle: ACTIVE & LEGITIMATE
        accordionContent: >
          * Does the provider have an active physical and/or web address?

          * Has the provider hosted events and/or updated online content within
          the past 6 months?

          * Is the provider responsive to email and/or phone outreach?
      - accordionTitle: LGBTQ+ AFFIRMING (GENERAL)
        accordionContent: >
          * Our trained volunteers deploy a multi-tiered vetting process to
          assess whether or not a service provider is generally ‘LGBTQ+
          affirming’.

          * **Step #1**: Is the organization’s mission to serve the LGBTQ+
          community (e.g., an LGBTQ+ center)?

          * **Step #2**: If ‘no’ to the above, our Resource Team looks at
          different factors / questions based on the type of organization:
            * Religiously affiliated organization (e.g., Catholic Charities, Salvation Army, a church or congregation, etc.);
            * Organization who “serves everyone” or is “open to all people in need” (e.g., a food pantry, an overnight shelter, etc.);
            * A medical/healthcare organization (e.g., a hospital, medical clinic, health center or healthcare system, etc.);
            * An immigrant-focused organization (e.g., a non-LGBTQ+ specific organization providing immigrants with English as a second language classes, or legal services, etc.);
            * Other (ie., none of the above accurately describes the organization)
          * Examples of things we look for include:
            * Anti-discrimination policy that clearly states banning discrimination for both sexual orientation and gender identity
            * LGBTQ+ community events or services (e.g., support groups, Pride month events on calendar)
            * Does your organization/clinic have experience working with members of the LGBTQ+ community?
            * Does your organization have any openly LGBTQ+ staff members? Do they receive the same benefits and policies as non-LGBTQ+ staff members? (e.g., family leave care; dependent policies; healthcare coverage)
            * Does your staff participate in any LGBTQ+ specific trainings and certifications?
      - accordionTitle: INREACH’S INTERSECTIONALITY DEFINITIONS
        accordionContent: >
          With our history in LGBTQ+ asylum, our organization was founded on the
          belief that every LGBTQ+ person deserves the safety and freedom to
          live authentically. We believe that achieving LGBTQ+ equality requires
          transgender justice, racial justice, refugee justice, reproductive
          justice, language justice, and more.


          As a result, in addition to satisfying our general LGBTQ+ affirming
          verification criteria, we look for (prefer but do not require to be
          listed on InReach) organizations who are ‘led by’ and/or have services
          ‘focused on’ serving historically marginalized LGBTQ+ communities.


          For example, we look for organizations who are led by those with
          relevant lived experience for LGBTQ+ people facing discrimination and
          persecution, such as organizations who are:


          * Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) led

          * Black led

          * Immigrant led

          * Trans led

          * \*Note: We hope to add new ‘led by’ categories in the future.


          We also look for organizations who provide services that are focused
          on serving a specific marginalized LGBTQ+ population(s), including:


          * Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) community

          * Immigrant community
            * Asylum seekers
            * Resettled refugees
          * LGBTQ+ youth
            * Trans youth
          * Spanish speakers

          * Trans community
            * Gender nonconforming community
            * Trans men and the transmasculine community
            * Trans women and the transfeminine community
            * Trans youth
          * \*Note: As our organization’s capacity grows, we hope to add new
          LGBTQ+ communities in the future.

          CAN DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS HELP TO UPDATE THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION'S
          INFORMATION?

          Great question! Our vision is to build a dynamic platform that
          incorporates regular community feedback, including from direct service
          providers listed on InReach.


          The ability for organizations to [“claim” their own profile on
          InReach](https://inreach.org/claimed-organizations/) is coming soon.

      # <ColoredText text="INREACH’S INTERSECTIONALITY DEFINITIONS" color="Ally
      Green" />


      Please see below for our intersectionality definitions (introduced in
      January 2023) outlining how InReach defines which organizations are ‘trans
      led’, ‘BIPOC led’, ‘immigrant led’, etc. and what it means for an
      organization to offer a service ‘focused on’ a specific LGBTQ+ community.


      **Definitions List #1**: Determining whether an organization meets any of
      InReach’s ‘led by” definitions


      For consistency, InReach uses an adapted version of the [Trans Justice
      Project definition](https://www.transjusticefundingproject.org/) of what
      it means to be ‘trans led’ for all of our community ‘led by’ definitions,
      as described below.

          that the majority of the people in charge of the group identify as
          trans or gender non-conforming. As applied to ‘BIPOC led’, “in charge”
          includes any of the following examples:
            * The director, if there is one, should identify as BIPOC.
            * The majority of the governing board collective, advisory committee, or similar governing body, if there is such a body, should identify as BIPOC.

      # <ColoredText text="Our Re-Verification Process" color="Ally Green" />


      We re-verify (repeat our tailored verification process described above)
      all of the direct service providers listed on InReach at least once every
      6 months for maximum user safety and data quality control purposes.


      In 2023, we switched from geography-based tiers for re-verifications to
      re-verifying organizations by time (i.e., ‘when last verified’).


      Our trained interns carry out the bulk of our crucial re-verifications.


      With increased capacity and support, we can continue to increase the
      frequency of our re-verifications to ensure our resource data remains
      up-to-date, 24/7. (Want to help? Make a [tax-deductible
      donation](https://inreach.org/donate/) today.)
