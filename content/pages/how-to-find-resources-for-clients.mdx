          HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THE DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS LISTED ON INREACH
          ARE SAFE FOR MEMBERS OF THE DIVERSE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY?
        accordionContent: >
          Every direct service provider listed on InReach is vetted by our
          trained volunteers to be welcoming to LGBTQ+ people facing persecution
          or discrimination.


          Our trained volunteers employ a rigorous tailored vetting process for
          all direct service providers listed on InReach. Our core vetting
          criteria include:


          Is the direct service provider active and legitimate? (required to be
          listed on InReach)

          Is the direct service provider LGBTQ+ affirming? (required to be
          listed on InReach)

          Does the direct service provider meet any of InReach’s
          intersectionality definitions? (preferred but not required to be
          listed on InReach)

          At InReach, we recognize that LGBTQ+ equality requires trans justice,
          racial justice, refugee justice, reproductive justice, language
          justice, and more. As a result, in addition to verifying that each
          provider listed on InReach is generally LGBTQ+ affirming, our trained
          volunteers also verify whether providers are led by and/or have
          expertise serving specific historically marginalized LGBTQ+
          communities.

          See our intersectionality definitions for more information.

          We repeat our vetting process for every provider listed on InReach at
          least once every 6 months.


          Please see the “Our Vetting Process” page for more information.
