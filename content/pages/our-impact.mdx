      <ColoredText text="Open Source" color="Ally Green" />:  InReach is built
      for scale and local community input.


      <ColoredText text="Vetted Resources Only" color="Ally Green" />: Every
      service provider listed on InReach is independently vetted (and
      re-verified at least once every 6 months) to be affirming for the diverse
      LGBTQ+ community by trained volunteers.


      <ColoredText text="Safety First" color="Ally Green" />: We know online
      anonymity can be a life-or-death issue for LGBTQ+ people. That’s why our
      app is designed to protect users’ confidentiality and safety online.


      <ColoredText text="Localization (Translation)" color="Ally Green" />\:As
      an open-source platform, InReach uses crowdsourced translations. Real
      people verify (and edit as needed) our machine-generated translations to
      ensure accuracy, inclusivity and cultural competence.


      <ColoredText text="Holistic" color="Ally Green" /><ColoredText />: InReach
      lists 15 categories of verified support, including trans-focused services,
      legal help, safe housing, meal assistance, abortion care, mental health
      and medical care, translation and interpretation, community support,
      financial assistance, and more.
    richTextRight: >
      <ColoredText text="Personalize Your Search" color="Ally Green" />: Users
      can easily filter out providers that require fees and specific
      documentation (e.g., photo ID, medical insurance, proof of
      age/income/residence, or a referral) to access.


      <ColoredText text="Leave Ratings and Reviews" color="Ally Green" />:
      Logged-in users can share public ratings (one to five stars) and reviews
      on all verified service providers’ profile pages.


      <ColoredText text="Suggest New Resources" color="Ally Green" />: Logged-in
      users can suggest new LGBTQ+ resources for inclusion in the app to
      InReach’s Resource Team.


      <ColoredText text="Save Resources" color="Ally Green" />: Logged-in users
      can bookmark their favorite resources for easy access later.


      <ColoredText text="Share Resources" color="Ally Green" />: Users can
      easily share trusted resources with loved ones and/or clients, ensuring
      everyone has access to the help they need.


      <ColoredText text="Sorting Search Results (Coming Soon)" color="Ally
      Green" />: Soon, you’ll be able to sort verified providers by LGBTQ+
      community focus (e.g., prioritize BIPOC, TGNC, and/or immigrant
      providers).


      <ColoredText text="Service Provider Features (Coming Soon)" color="Ally
      Green" />: Providers who register for a free user account and “claim”
      their organization’s profile will gain access to a suite of free tools to
      showcase their services on InReach.

          “Social workers often make referrals to other organizations and
          providers to meet all of our clients’ needs. It is important to
          connect people with the resources and support they need in a timely
          manner, and it is imperative that services and service providers are
          safe and affirming. I share the InReach app not only with clients, but
          also with other service providers, to ensure that clients who are part
          of the LGBTQ community are connected with the mental health, medical,
          legal, and other services to meet all of their needs.” -InReach App

          "The LGBTQ+ asylum process can be very isolating for many asylum
          seekers who continue to face daily challenges in the U.S. Access to
          legal representation and other basic resources can often make a big
          difference in their ability to rebuild their lives. I have used the
          InReach App to find LGBTQ-affirming legal resources that are
          instrumental in helping me navigate the convoluted immigration process
          for my long pathway to citizenship.” -InReach App User

          "When I first began my transition in my 20’s I didn’t know where to
          start. InReach helped me access the resources necessary to step into
          my identity as a trans man. I used the app to locate affirming legal
          help for my name and gender maker changes, gender affirming medical
          care and mental health services as I navigated my transition." InReach

          “Working in the pro bono legal services sector, our clients, who were
          asylum-seekers and other LGBTQI+ folks in vulnerable situations, would
          often ask for advice beyond the realm of legal help that we provide.
          As a paralegal, it was difficult to research this information in an
          individualized manner, until I found InReach. I was then able to use
          the InReach App to find safe and reliable service providers that would
          address our clients’ needs and to connect them with relevant and
          urgently needed social services. This invaluable online resource
          proved life-saving and life-changing for so many of our clients.“

          "My family lives in a hostile state that has already outlawed gender
          affirming care for my child. We use the app as part of our survival
          strategy. There are too many barriers to relocation at the moment, so
          we are using the app to find the closest care. We are also using the
          app to determine where we will go when it is no longer can remain
          here. We need resources for the whole family and trust the resources

          across the country who are in criss. They are facing issues like
          family discrimination, impending loss of housing, bullying, coming out
          loss, self-injury, and exploring gender identity. I use the free
          InReach App to find safe local service providers for our contacts, for

          providers peace of mind; when we recommend their service, we know that
          our LGBTQI+ clients will receive affirming and supportive services
          that have been vetted by the InReach team. I never want to expose my
          clients to more harm, and InReach helps me feel confident in my
