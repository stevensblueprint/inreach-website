      \*Note: Following our safety-first approach, we do not require any
      personally identifiable information to use the InReach App. Users who
      choose to create a free InReach user account have the option to share
      demographic information via an anonymous online survey. All of this
      sensitive information is stored anonymously and not connected to any
      single individual user or user account.
