          HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THE DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS LISTED ON INREACH
          ARE SAFE FOR MEMBERS OF THE DIVERSE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY?
        accordionContent: >
          Every direct service provider listed on InReach is vetted by our
          trained volunteers to be welcoming to LGBTQ+ people facing persecution
          or discrimination.


          Our trained volunteers employ a rigorous tailored vetting process for
          all direct service providers listed on InReach. Our core vetting
          criteria include:


          * Is the direct service provider active and legitimate? (required to
          be listed on InReach)

          * Is the direct service provider LGBTQ+ affirming? (required to be
          listed on InReach)

          * Does the direct service provider meet any of InReach’s
          intersectionality definitions? (preferred but not required to be
          listed on InReach)


          At InReach, we recognize that LGBTQ+ equality requires trans justice,
          racial justice, refugee justice, reproductive justice, language
          justice, and more. As a result, in addition to verifying that each
          provider listed on InReach is generally LGBTQ+ affirming, our trained
          volunteers also verify whether providers are led by and/or have
          expertise serving specific historically marginalized LGBTQ+
          communities.


          *

          * See [our intersectionality
          definitions](https://inreach.org/vetting-process/) for more
          information.


          We repeat our vetting process for every provider listed on InReach at
          least once every 6 months.


          Please see the [“Our Vetting Process”
          page](https://inreach.org/vetting-process/) for more information.

  - blockTitle: About InReach
    content:
      - accordionTitle: HOW DID INREACH START?
        accordionContent: >
          Jamie co-founded InReach (fka AsylumConnect) during his senior year at
          the University of Pennsylvania. At Penn, a classmate shared his
          personal experience struggling to find safe resources during the U.S.
          asylum process despite access to technology. As a trans man who grew
          up in a conservative environment, the feeling of not being able to
          live authentically and lacking easily accessible information on how to
          find affirming support deeply resonated with Jamie. So, during their
          senior year, the two friends co-founded AsylumConnect, a 501(c)(3)
          nonprofit organization started as the world’s first technology
          platform for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, to fill the critical resource
          information gap facing the diverse LGBTQ+ community. The organization
          is founded on the belief that every LGBTQ+ person deserves the safety
          and freedom to live authentically.


          In May 2022, AsylumConnect officially became InReach. Since launching
          its app in 2016, the organization has seen the platform be used by a
          wide variety of LGBTQ+ people, in addition to those seeking asylum.
          The organization rebranded to InReach to better communicate and
          reflect the value of its free technology to a diverse LGBTQ+ user
          base.


          Today, InReach has verified services for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers,
          refugees and other immigrants, LGBTQ+ BIPOC communities, the
          transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) community, LGBTQ+ youth
          and their caregivers, and more LGBTQ+ communities.
      - accordionTitle: WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO REBRAND FROM ASYLUMCONNECT TO INREACH?
        accordionContent: >
          Since launching in 2016, we have seen our free tech platform be used
          by a wide variety of LGBTQ+ people, in addition to those seeking
          asylum. As a result, we decided to rebrand our organization from
          AsylumConnect to InReach to better communicate and reflect the value
          of our App to a broader user base. We are committed to ensuring all
          members of the diverse LGBTQ+ community–including asylum seekers and
          refugees, undocumented and other immigrants, young people experiencing
          homelessness, those facing family or community rejection due to their
          identity, and other transgender and non-binary people in need of safe
          resources–always have access to trusted information on where it is
          safe to go for help.


          Please see [our press release](https://prn.to/3lMPU5Y) for more
          information on our decision to rebrand from AsylumConnect to InReach.
      - accordionTitle: >-
          DOES THIS REBRANDING TO INREACH MARK A SHIFT AWAY FROM SERVING LGBTQ+
          ASYLUM SEEKERS ?
        accordionContent: >
          No. We are very proud of our history and we intend to remain the go-to
          platform for LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum.


          We began by validating our free technology model and user need with
          LGBTQ+ asylum seekers. Now that it’s clear that other LGBTQ+ people
          can benefit from our product as well, we are expanding. The new
          InReach brand reflects the growth of our organization.
      - accordionTitle: WHY THE NAME “INREACH”?
        accordionContent: >
          Our governing board of directors worked with a digital marketing
          agency [B-Reel](https://www.b-reel.com/) on choosing our
          organization’s new name and logo. Our goal was to choose a new name
          that more effectively communicates who our free technology is able to
          help, while continuing to honor our organization’s history.


          Our new name (“InReach”) strives to invoke a sense of hope and
          encompasses what our tech platform aims to accomplish at scale: safe
          help is InReach for all members of our diverse LGBTQ+ community.
      - accordionTitle: WHERE IS THIS ORGANIZATION BASED?
        accordionContent: >
          We are based in the United States. Our team is remote, with board
          members, advisors, staff, volunteers, and interns located across the
          country. We do not accept in-person appointments.


          You can access [the free InReach App](https://app.inreach.org/) 24/7
          on desktop or mobile from around the world to connect with safe,
          verified legal, medical, mental health and social services near you.
